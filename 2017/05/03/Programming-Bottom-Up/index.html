<p><i>(This essay is from the introduction to </i><a href="onlisp.html">On Lisp</a>.<i>  The red text<br>explains the origins of <a href="arc.html">Arc</a>‘s name.)</i><br><br>It’s a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional<br>elements of a program should not be too large.  If some component of a<br>program grows beyond the stage where it’s readily comprehensible,<br>it becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily<br>as a big city conceals fugitives.  Such software will be<br>hard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.<br><br>In accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided<br>into pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided.<br>How do you divide a program?  The traditional approach is<br>called <i>top-down design:</i> you say “the purpose of the<br>program is to do these seven things, so I divide it into seven major<br>subroutines.  The first subroutine has to do these four things, so<br>it in turn will have four of its own subroutines,” and so on.<br>This process continues until the whole program has the right level<br>of granularity– each part large enough to do something substantial,<br>but small enough to be understood as a single unit.<br><br>Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently.<br>As well as top-down design, they follow a principle which<br>could be called <i>bottom-up design</i>– changing the language<br>to suit the problem.<br>In Lisp, you don’t just write your program down toward the language,<br>you also build the language up toward your program.  As you’re<br>writing a program you may think “I wish Lisp had such-and-such an<br>operator.” So you go and write it. Afterward<br>you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design<br>of another part of the program, and so on.<br>Language and program evolve together.<br>Like the border between two warring states,<br>the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn,<br>until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers,<br>the natural frontiers of your problem.<br>In the end your program will look as if the language had been<br>designed for it.<br>And when language and<br>program fit one another well, you end up with code which is<br>clear, small, and efficient.<br><br><font color="#880000"><br>It’s worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn’t mean<br>just writing the same program in a different order.  When you<br>work bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program.<br>Instead of a single, monolithic program,<br>you will get a larger language with more abstract operators,<br>and a smaller program written in it.  Instead of a lintel,<br>you’ll get an arch.<br></font><br><br>In typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are<br>merely bookkeeping, what’s left is much shorter;<br>the higher you build up the language, the less distance you<br>will have to travel from the top down to it.<br>This brings several advantages:<br><br></p><ol><p></p>
<p><li> By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design<br>yields programs which are smaller and more agile.  A shorter<br>program doesn’t have to be divided into so many components, and<br>fewer components means programs which are easier to read or<br>modify.  Fewer components also means fewer connections between<br>components, and thus less chance for errors there.  As<br>industrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving parts<br>in a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design<br>to reduce the size and complexity of their programs.<br><br></li><li> Bottom-up design promotes code re-use.<br>When you write two<br>or more programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the first<br>program will also be useful in the succeeding ones.  Once you’ve<br>acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can<br>take only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to<br>start with raw Lisp.<br><br></li><li> Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read.<br><!--
%It yields the same result as top-down design
%with foresight---the foresight to arrange the branches near the
%root of the tree so that among the leaves there is as little
%duplication of effort as possible.
--><br>An instance of this type<br>of abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator;<br>an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understand<br>a special-purpose subroutine. [1]<br><br></li><li> Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns<br>in your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about<br>the design of your program.  If two distant components of a program<br>are similar in form, you’ll be led to notice the similarity and<br>perhaps to redesign the program in a simpler way.<br></li></p></ol><br>Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages<br>other than Lisp.  Whenever you see library functions,<br>bottom-up design is happening.  However, Lisp gives you much broader<br>powers in this department, and augmenting the language plays a<br>proportionately larger role in Lisp style– so much so that<br>Lisp is not just a different language, but a whole different way<br>of programming.<br><br>It’s true that this style of development is better suited to<br>programs which can be written by small groups.  However, at the<br>same time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a small<br>group.  In <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>,<br>Frederick Brooks<br>proposed that the productivity of a group of programmers<br>does not grow linearly with its size.  As the size of the<br>group increases, the productivity of individual programmers<br>goes down.  The experience of Lisp programming<br>suggests a more cheerful way<br>to phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, the<br>productivity of individual programmers goes up.<br>A small group wins, relatively speaking, simply because it’s<br>smaller.  When a small group also takes advantage of the<br>techniques that Lisp makes possible, it can<br><a href="avg.html">win outright</a>.<br><br><br><br><b>New:</b> <a href="onlisptext.html">Download On Lisp for Free</a>.<br><br><br><br><p></p><hr><br><br><br>[1] “But no one can read<br>the program without understanding all your new utilities.”<br>To see why such statements are usually mistaken,<br>see Section 4.8.<br><p></p>
