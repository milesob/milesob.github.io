<p>“In France those absurd perversions of the art of war which covered themselves under the name of chivalry were more omnipotent than in any other country of Europe.

<p>“As all these results were obtained, not by any heroic method, but by patient and detailed reasoning, I began to think it probable that philosophy had erred in adopting heroic remedies for intellectual difficulties, and that solutions were to be found merely by greater care and accuracy.

<p>“The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.”</p>
<p>□ John F. Kennedy<br><br></p>

<p>“The qualities that made for success in a fighter□pilot seemed to be just those sturdy qualities that made for success in other professions; observation, initiative, determination, courage, including the courage to run away.

<p>□ Jim Bailey, The Sky Suspended<br><br></p>
<p>“Everything about it was visibly mis□shapen, corrupt, crawling, verminous; for a time I could not bear to look at it, and passed with averted eyes; recovering from this weakness, I forced myself to look, and to face day by day the question: a thing so obviously, so incontrovertibly, so indefensibly bad, why had Scott done it?”</p>
<p>□ R. G. Collingwood on the Albert Memorial<br><br></p>
<p>“Anybody who cares less about wanting to be cool, I think, is more interesting.”</p>
<p>□ Aimee Mann<br><br></p>
<p>“The late Richard Feynman, a superb physicist, said once as we talked about the laser that the way to tell a great idea is that, when people hear it, they say, ‘Gee, I could have thought of that.’”</p>
<p>□ Charles Townes, How the Laser Happened<br><br></p>
<p>“If we chose always to be wise we should rarely need to be virtuous. But inclinations which we could easily overcome irresistibly attract us. We give in to slight temptations and minimize the danger. We fall insensibly into dangerous situations, from which we could easily have safeguarded ourselves, but from which we cannot withdraw without heroic efforts which appal us. So finally, as we tumble into the abyss, we ask God why he has made us so feeble. But, in spite of ourselves, He replies through our consciences: ‘I have made you too feeble to climb out of the pit, because I made you strong enough not to fall in.’”</p>
<p>□ Rousseau, Confessions, Cohen trans.<br><br></p>

<p>□ John Hoyt Williams, A Great and Shining Road<br><br></p>
<p>“That 95 per cent. fail of those who start in business upon their own account seems incredible, and yet such are said to be the statistics upon the subject.”</p>
<p>□ Andrew Carnegie, 1896<br><br></p>
<p>“You should never turn a man’s generosity as a sword against him. Any virtue that a man has, even if he has many vices, should not be used as a tool against him.”</p>
<p>□ Rabi to Feynman<br><br></p>
<p>“You can’t say I didn’t try really hard, ‘cause I’m trying really hard to be good.”</p>
<p>□ Tom Petty<br><br></p>
<p>“He begins working calculus problems in his head as soon as he awakens. He did calculus while driving in his car, while sitting in the living room, and while lying in bed at night.”</p>
<p>□ divorce complaint of Richard Feynman’s second wife<br><br></p>
<p>“The development of this aircraft was long and complex even by Soviet standards, partially explained by the fact that its entire design team was in jail.”</p>
<p>□ Howard Moon on the TU□2<br><br></p>
<p>“It is said that there is a technical term for people who believe that little boys and little girls are born indistinguishable and are molded into their natures by parental socialization. The term is ‘childless.’”</p>

<p>□ Sherlock Holmes<br><br></p>
<p>His notions fitted things so well,<br>That which was which he could not tell;<br>But oftentimes mistook th’ one<br>For th’ other, as great clerks have done.</p>
<p>□ Samuel Butler, Hudibras<br><br></p>
<p>“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.”</p>
<p>□ John Gall<br><br></p>
<p>“The Muslims of al□Andalus had nothing to learn from their Christian neighbours and were incurious about them. Geographers’ accounts of Christian Spain tended to be cursory in the extreme: it was cold, the inhabitants were barbarians who ate pigs, you could get slaves there – that was about the sum of it.”</p>
<p>□ Richard Fletcher, Moorish Spain<br><br></p>
<p>“When the enemy is making a false movement we must take good care not to interrupt him.”</p>
<p>□ Napoleon<br><br></p>
<p>“Leave me alone, I’m trying to build! Don’t you know how people build? By concentrating!”</p>
<p>□ my 5 year old son, building Lego<br><br></p>
<p>“An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field.”</p>
<p>□ Niels Bohr<br><br></p>
