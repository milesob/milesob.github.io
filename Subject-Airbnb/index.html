        <p>March 2011</p>
<p>Yesterday Fred Wilson published a remarkable post about missing Airbnb. VCs miss good startups all the time, but it’s extraordinarily rare for one to talk about it publicly till long afterward. So that post is further evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He’s probably the nicest VC I know.</p>
<p>Reading Fred’s post made me go back and look at the emails I exchanged with him at the time, trying to convince him to invest in Airbnb. It was quite interesting to read. You can see Fred’s mind at work as he circles the deal.</p>
<p>Fred and the Airbnb founders have generously agreed to let me publish this email exchange (with one sentence redacted about something that’s strategically important to Airbnb and not an important part of the conversation). It’s an interesting illustration of an element of the startup ecosystem that few except the participants ever see: investors trying to convince one another to invest in their portfolio companies. Hundreds if not thousands of conversations of this type are happening now, but if one has ever been published, I haven’t seen it. The Airbnbs themselves never even saw these emails at the time.</p>
<p>We do a lot of this behind the scenes stuff at YC, because we invest in such a large number of companies, and we invest so early that investors sometimes need a lot of convincing to see their merits. I don’t always try as hard as this though. Fred must have found me quite annoying.</p>

<p>One of the startups from the batch that just started, AirbedAndBreakfast,<br>is in NYC right now meeting their users.  (NYC is their biggest<br>market.) I’d recommend meeting them if your schedule allows.</p>
<p>I’d been thinking to myself that though these guys were going to<br>do really well, I should introduce them to angels, because VCs would<br>never go for it.  But then I thought maybe I should give you more<br>credit.  You’ll certainly like meeting them.  Be sure to ask about<br>how they funded themselves with breakfast cereal.</p>
<p>There’s no reason this couldn’t be as big as Ebay.  And this team<br>is the right one to do it.</p>

<p>It’s a longshot, at this stage, but if there was any VC who’d get<br>you guys, it would be Fred.  He is the least suburban-golf-playing<br>VC I know.</p>
<p>He likes to observe startups for a while before acting, so don’t<br>be bummed if he seems ambivalent.</p>

<p>Thanks Paul</p>
<p>We are having a bit of a debate inside our partnership about the<br>airbed concept. We’ll finish that debate tomorrow in our weekly<br>meeting and get back to you with our thoughts</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Fred</p>

<p>I’d recommend having the debate after meeting them instead of before.<br>We had big doubts about this idea, but they vanished on meeting the<br>guys.</p>
<p>from: Fred Wilson<br>to: Paul Graham<br>date: Mon, Jan 26, 2009 at 11:08 AM<br>subject: RE: meet the airbeds</p>
<p>We are still very suspect of this idea but will take a meeting as<br>you suggest</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Airbed team -</p>
<p>Are you still in NYC?</p>
<p>We’d like to meet if you are</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Ideas can morph.  Practically every really big startup could say,<br>five years later, “believe it or not, we started out doing ___.”<br>It just seemed a very good sign to me that these guys were actually<br>on the ground in NYC hunting down (and understanding) their users.<br>On top of several previous good signs.</p>

<p>from: Fred Wilson<br>to: Paul Graham<br>date: Sun, Feb 1, 2009 at 7:15 AM<br>subject: Re: meet the airbeds</p>
<p>It’s interesting</p>
<p>Our two junior team members were enthusiastic</p>
<p>The three “old guys” didn’t get it</p>
<p>from: Paul Graham<br>to: Fred Wilson<br>date: Mon, Feb 9, 2009 at 5:58 PM<br>subject: airbnb</p>
<p>The Airbeds just won the first poll among all the YC startups in<br>their batch by a landslide.  In the past this has not been a 100%<br>indicator of success (if only anything were) but much better than<br>random.</p>

<p>I met them today</p>
<p>They have an interesting business</p>
<p>I’m just not sure how big it’s going to be</p>
<p>fred</p>
<p>from: Paul Graham<br>to: Fred Wilson<br>date: Sat, Feb 14, 2009 at 9:50 AM<br>subject: Re: airbnb</p>
<p>Did they explain the long-term goal of being the market in accommodation<br>the way eBay is in stuff?  That seems like it would be huge.  Hotels<br>now are like airlines in the 1970s before they figured out how to<br>increase their load factors.</p>
<p>from: Fred Wilson<br>to: Paul Graham<br>date: Tue, Feb 17, 2009 at 2:05 PM<br>subject: Re: airbnb</p>
<p>They did but I am not sure I buy that</p>
<p>ABNB reminds me of Etsy in that it facilitates real commerce in a<br>marketplace model directly between two people</p>
<p>So I think it can scale all the way to the bed and breakfast market</p>
<p>But I am not sure they can take on the hotel market</p>
<p>I could be wrong</p>
<p>But even so, if you include short term room rental, second home<br>rental, bed and breakfast, and other similar classes of accommodations,<br>you get to a pretty big opportunity</p>

<p>from: Paul Graham<br>to: Fred Wilson<br>date: Wed, Feb 18, 2009 at 12:21 AM<br>subject: Re: airbnb</p>
<p>So invest in them!  They’re very capital efficient.  They would<br>make an investor’s money go a long way.</p>
<p>It’s also counter-cyclical.  They just arrived back from NYC, and<br>when I asked them what was the most significant thing they’d observed,<br>it was how many of their users actually needed to do these rentals<br>to pay their rents.</p>

<p>from: Fred Wilson<br>to: Paul Graham<br>date: Wed, Feb 18, 2009 at 2:21 AM<br>subject: Re: airbnb</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like</p>
<p>I’ve done a few things, like intro it to my friends at Foundry who<br>were investors in Service Metrics and understand this model</p>
<p>I am also talking to my friend Mark Pincus who had an idea like<br>this a few years ago.</p>
<p>So we are working on it</p>
<p>Thanks for the lead</p>
<p>Fred</p>

<p>I know you’re skeptical they’ll ever get hotels, but there’s a<br>continuum between private sofas and hotel rooms, and they just moved<br>one step further along it.</p>
<p>[link to an airbnb user]</p>
<p>This is after only a few months.  I bet you they will get hotels<br>eventually.  It will start with small ones.  Just wait till all the<br>10-room pensiones in Rome discover this site.  And once it spreads<br>to hotels, where is the point (in size of chain) at which it stops?<br>Once something becomes a big marketplace, you ignore it at your<br>peril.</p>

<p>from: Fred Wilson<br>to: Paul Graham<br>date: Sat, Feb 21, 2009 at 4:26 AM<br>subject: Re: airbnb already spreading to pros</p>
<p>That’s true. It’s also true that there are quite a few marketplaces<br>out there that serve this same market</p>
<p>If you look at many of the people who list at ABNB, they list<br>elsewhere too</p>
<p>I am not negative on this one, I am interested, but we are still<br>in the gathering data phase.</p>
