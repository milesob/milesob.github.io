And<br>yet when I was in high school it wouldn’t have seemed too far off<br>as a description of the US.  Which means things must have been<br>changing here.<br><br>The course of people’s lives in the US now seems to be determined<br>less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years<br>ago.  Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used<br>to.<br><br>What happened?<br><br><center><strong>_</strong></center><br><br>Judging people by their academic credentials was in its time an<br>advance.  The practice seems to have begun in China, where starting<br>in 587 candidates for the imperial civil service had to take an<br>exam on classical literature.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font> It was also a test of wealth,<br>because the knowledge it tested was so specialized that passing<br>required years of expensive training.  But though wealth was a<br>necessary condition for passing, it was not a sufficient one.  By<br>the standards of the rest of the world in 587, the Chinese system<br>was very enlightened.  Europeans didn’t introduce formal civil<br>service exams till the nineteenth century, and even then they seem<br>to have been influenced by the Chinese example.<br><br>Before credentials, government positions were obtained mainly by<br>family influence, if not outright bribery.   It was a great step<br>forward to judge people by their performance on a test.  But by no<br>means a perfect solution.  When you judge people that way, you tend<br>to get cram schools—which they did in Ming China and nineteenth<br>century England just as much as in present day South Korea.<br><br>What cram schools are, in effect, is leaks in a seal.  The use of<br>credentials<br>was an attempt to seal off the direct transmission of power between<br>generations, and cram schools represent that power finding holes<br>in the seal.  Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into<br>credentials in the next.<br><br>It’s hard to beat this phenomenon, because the schools adjust to suit<br>whatever the tests measure.  When the tests are narrow and<br>predictable, you get cram schools on the classic model, like those<br>that prepared candidates for Sandhurst (the British West Point) or<br>the classes American students take now to improve their SAT scores.<br>But as the tests get broader, the schools do too.  Preparing a<br>candidate for the Chinese imperial civil service exams took years,<br>as prep school does today.  But the raison d’etre of all these<br>institutions has been the same: to beat the system.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br><center><strong>_</strong></center><br><br>History suggests that, all other things being equal, a society<br>prospers in proportion to its ability to prevent parents from<br>influencing their children’s success directly.  It’s a fine thing<br>for parents to help their children indirectly—for example,<br>by helping them to become smarter or more disciplined, which then<br>makes them more successful.  The problem comes when parents use<br>direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth or power<br>as a substitute for their children’s qualities.<br><br>Parents will tend to do this when they can.  Parents will die for<br>their kids, so it’s not surprising to find they’ll also push their<br>scruples to the limits for them.  Especially if other parents are<br>doing it.<br><br>Sealing off this force has a double advantage.  Not only does a<br>society get “the best man for the job,” but<br>parents’ ambitions are diverted from direct methods to indirect<br>ones—to actually trying to raise their kids well.<br><br>But we should expect it to be very hard to contain parents’ efforts<br>to obtain an unfair advantage for their kids.  We’re dealing with<br>one of the most powerful forces in human nature.  We shouldn’t expect<br>naive solutions to work, any more than we’d expect naive solutions<br>for keeping heroin out of a prison to work.<br><br><center><strong>_</strong></center><br><br>The obvious way to solve the problem is to make credentials better.<br>If the tests a society uses are currently hackable, we can study<br>the way people beat them and try to plug the holes.  You can use<br>the cram schools to show you where most of the holes are.  They<br>also tell you when you’re succeeding in fixing them: when cram<br>schools become less popular.<br><br>A more general solution<br>would be to push for increased transparency, especially at critical<br>social bottlenecks like college admissions.  In the US this process<br>still shows many outward signs of corruption.  For example, legacy<br>admissions.  The official story is that legacy status doesn’t carry<br>much weight, because all it does is break ties: applicants are<br>bucketed by ability, and legacy status is only used to decide between<br>the applicants in the bucket that straddles the cutoff.  But what<br>this means is that a university can make legacy status have as much<br>or as little weight as they want, by adjusting the size of the<br>bucket that straddles the cutoff.<br><br>By gradually chipping away at the abuse of credentials, you could<br>probably make them more airtight.  But what a long fight it would<br>be.  Especially when the institutions administering the tests don’t<br>really want them to be airtight.<br><br><center><strong>_</strong></center><br><br>Fortunately there’s a better way to prevent the direct transmission<br>of power between generations.  Instead of trying to make credentials<br>harder to hack, we can also make them matter less.<br><br>Let’s think about what credentials are for.  What they are,<br>functionally, is a way of predicting performance.  If you could<br>measure actual performance, you wouldn’t need them.<br><br>So why did they even evolve?  Why haven’t we just been measuring<br>actual performance?  Think about where credentialism first appeared:<br>in selecting candidates for large organizations.  Individual<br>performance is hard to measure in large organizations, and the<br>harder performance is to measure, the more important it is<br>to predict it.  If an organization could immediately and cheaply<br>measure the performance of recruits, they wouldn’t need to examine<br>their credentials.  They could take everyone and keep just the good<br>ones.<br><br>Large organizations can’t do this.  But a bunch of small organizations<br>in a market can come close.  A market takes every organization and<br>keeps just the good ones.  As organizations get smaller, this<br>approaches taking every person and keeping just the good ones.  So<br>all other things being equal, a society consisting of more, smaller<br>organizations will care less about credentials.<br><br><center><strong>_</strong></center><br><br>That’s what’s been happening in the US.  That’s why those quotes<br>from Korea sound so old fashioned.  They’re talking about an economy<br>like America’s a few decades ago, dominated by a few big companies.<br>The route for the ambitious in that sort of environment is to join<br>one and climb to the top.  Credentials matter a lot then.  In the<br>culture of a large organization, an elite pedigree becomes a self-fulfilling<br>prophecy.<br><br>This doesn’t work in small companies.  Even if your colleagues were<br>impressed by your credentials, they’d soon be parted from you if<br>your performance didn’t match, because the company would go out of<br>business and the people would be dispersed.<br><br>In a world of small companies, performance is all anyone cares<br>about.  People hiring for a startup don’t care whether you’ve even<br>graduated from college, let alone which one.  All they care about<br>is what you can do.  Which is in fact all that should matter, even<br>in a large organization.  The reason credentials have such prestige<br>is that for so long the large organizations<br>in a society tended to be the most powerful.  But in the US at least<br>they don’t have the monopoly on power they once did, precisely<br>because they can’t measure (and thus reward) individual performance.<br>Why spend twenty years climbing the corporate ladder when you can<br>get rewarded directly by the market?<br><br>I realize I see a more exaggerated version of the change than most<br>other people.  As a partner at an early stage venture funding firm,<br>I’m like a jumpmaster shoving people out of the old world of<br>credentials and into the new one of performance.  I’m an agent of<br>the change I’m seeing.  But I don’t think I’m imagining it.  It was<br>not so easy 25 years ago for an ambitious person to choose to be<br>judged directly by the market.  You had to go through bosses, and<br>they were influenced by where you’d been to college.<br><br><center><strong>_</strong></center><br><br>What made it possible for small organizations to succeed in America?<br>I’m still not entirely sure.  Startups are certainly a large part<br>of it.  Small organizations can develop new ideas faster than large<br>ones, and new ideas are increasingly valuable.<br><br>But I don’t think startups account for all the shift from credentials<br>to measurement.  My friend Julian Weber told me that when he went<br>to work for a New York law firm in the 1950s they paid associates<br>far less than firms do today.  Law firms then made no pretense of<br>paying people according to the value of the work they’d done.  Pay<br>was based on seniority.  The younger employees were paying their<br>dues.  They’d be rewarded later.<br><br>The same principle prevailed at industrial companies.  When my<br>father was working at Westinghouse in the 1970s, he had people<br>working for him who made more than he did, because they’d been there<br>longer.<br><br>Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for<br>the work they do.   One reason is that employees no longer trust<br>companies to deliver<br><a href="ladder.html">deferred rewards</a>: why work to accumulate<br>deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken<br>over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out?  The other<br>is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees<br>large amounts.  This was particularly true in consulting, law, and<br>finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies.  The word is<br>rarely used today because it’s no longer surprising to see a 25<br>year old with money, but in 1985 the sight of a 25 year old<br><i>professional</i> able to afford a new BMW was so novel that it<br>called forth a new word.<br><br>The classic yuppie worked for a small organization.  He didn’t work<br>for General Widget, but for the law firm that handled General<br>Widget’s acquisitions or the investment bank that floated their<br>bond issues.<br><br>Startups and yuppies entered the American conceptual vocabulary<br>roughly simultaneously in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  I don’t<br>think there was a causal connection.  Startups happened because<br>technology started to change so fast that big companies could no<br>longer keep a lid on the smaller ones.  I don’t think the rise of<br>yuppies was inspired by it; it seems more as if there was a change<br>in the social conventions (and perhaps the laws) governing the way<br>big companies worked.  But the two phenomena rapidly fused to produce<br>a principle that now seems obvious: paying energetic young people<br>market rates, and getting correspondingly high performance from<br>them.<br><br>At about the same time the US economy rocketed out of the doldrums<br>that had afflicted it for most of the 1970s.  Was there a connection?<br>I don’t know enough to say, but it felt like it at the time.  There<br>was a lot of energy released.<br><br><center><strong>_</strong></center><br><br>Countries worried about their competitiveness are right to be<br>concerned about the number of startups started within them.  But<br>they would do even better to examine the underlying principle.  Do<br>they let energetic young people get paid market rate for the work<br>they do?  The young are the test, because when people aren’t rewarded<br>according to performance, they’re invariably rewarded according to<br>seniority instead.<br><br>All it takes is a few beachheads in your economy that pay for<br>performance.  Measurement spreads like heat.  If one part of a<br>society is better at measurement than others, it tends to push the<br>others to do better.  If people who are young but smart and driven<br>can make more by starting their own companies than by working for<br>existing ones, the existing companies are forced to pay more to<br>keep them.  So market rates gradually permeate every organization,<br>even the government.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>The measurement of performance will tend to push even the organizations<br>issuing credentials into line.  When we were kids I used to annoy<br>my sister by ordering her to do things I knew she was about to do<br>anyway.  As credentials are superseded by performance, a similar<br>role is the best former gatekeepers can hope for.  Once credential<br>granting institutions are no longer in the self-fullfilling prophecy<br>business, they’ll have to work harder to predict the future.<br><br><center><strong>_</strong></center><br><br>Credentials are a step beyond bribery and influence.  But they’re<br>not the final step.  There’s an even better way to block the<br>transmission of power between generations: to encourage the trend<br>toward an economy made of more, smaller units.  Then you can measure<br>what credentials merely predict.<br><br>No one likes the transmission of power between generations—not<br>the left or the right.  But the market forces favored by the right<br>turn out to be a better way of preventing it than the credentials<br>the left are forced to fall back on.<br><br>The era of credentials began to end when the power of large<br>organizations <a href="highres.html">peaked</a><br>in the late twentieth century.  Now we seem<br>to be entering a new era based on measurement.  The reason the new<br>model has advanced so rapidly is that it works so much better.

<p>Notes</p>
<p>[1] Miyazaki, Ichisada (Conrad Schirokauer trans.), China’s Examination Hell: The Civil Service Examinations of Imperial China, Yale University Press, 1981.</p>
<p>Scribes in ancient Egypt took exams, but they were more the type of proficiency test any apprentice might have to pass.</p>
<p>[2] When I say the raison d’etre of prep schools is to get kids into better colleges, I mean this in the narrowest sense. I’m not saying that’s all prep schools do, just that if they had zero effect on college admissions there would be far less demand for them.</p>
<p>[3] Progressive tax rates will tend to damp this effect, however, by decreasing the difference between good and bad measurers.</p>
